                <p class="fade-in">
                    Hi, I am Hsing-Yu Chen, I come from Taiwan.
                    This is my first semester in UQ and I am very excited about it. 
                    I have a bachelor's degree of Sociology, and I worked in a DBMS company for 3 years after graduated. 
                    Currently, I am a student of MInfTech and keen to learn more about programming.

            <p class="fade-in">
                This portfolio aims to present the critical works I have completed during this course, 
                including the brainstorming, materials, developing process, and result of each assignment.
                It is also an opportunity to show my design skills by styling this website by myself.
            </p>

            <h3 class="fade-in">Inspiration</h3>
            <p class="fade-in">
                Since I have never built a portfolio before, I began by 
                browsing some great examples from students who have previously 
                taken DECO1800/DECO7180. To see how they organized their content, 
                how they styled their portfolio, and how they used some elements 
                to make the website more engaging. By doing that, I know 
                how should I plan my portfolio with my style.

                Then I started sketching out some layout concepts and some design 
                elements. I use a color palettes tool to help me decide what color 
                I want to implement on this website. In the beginning, I chose "Color palettes 1" 
                because yellow is one of my favorite color, which represents my personality, 
                and purple represents UQ.

                After determining the theme color, I created the HTML and added some content

                wanted to try to use yellow and purple together, but I did not prefer the result. 
                The outcome ("First version layout") made me think of an NBA team Lakers, which 
                is not what I wanted.

                After several tests, I decided not to put yellow and purple at the same time. 
                Instead of that, I slightly changed my color palettes. I chose yellow as my main 
                color and use black and white to match with it. The purple only use for some small proportion of decoration.

            <p class="fade-in">
                In this assignment, I have to explore the datasets 
                provided by the Brisbane council and the Queensland government. 
                The datasets are related to 5 different topics, which I have to 
                stimulate engaging ways to present the data.
            </p>

            <h3 class="fade-in">Idea Development</h3>
            <p class="fade-in">
                I began by browsing around the 5 briefs and seeing what datasets 
                available. My strategy was instead of viewing all datasets 
                in detail, I first chose the data topic I felt interested in. 
                Then, I looked at those data attributes and tried to roughly 
                picture how these value could work and how can I present 
                them on a website. <br>
                <br>
                After spending some time exploring and brainstorming, I found 
                an interesting dataset, which is recording the art collections 
                located in Brisbane. I imagined that it could be an appealing feature
                for people who want to learn the culture of Brisbane.

            </article>

            <p class="fade-in">
                Then, I created the first sketch of my idea. This is a platform 
                for people to search for the artworks in Brisbane, and I tried to extend this 
                idea as the foundation by connecting other datasets and thinking of 
                more detailed functionality.
            </p>

            <h3 class="fade-in">Poster</h3>
            <p class="fade-in">
                Eventually, I found another dataset for Brisbane's events that 
                I thought it could be perfectly combined with the artwork dataset. 
                By adding event data, I narrowed down my target audience to citizens 
                and tourists who intend to attend these events and are interested in 
                exploring the artworks in Brisbane.<br>
                <br>
                I have also considered using Twitter APIs so it could have some more interactive 
                features. For example, users can tweet about these artworks, so their comments 
                and photos could store in the database. Furthermore, this data could use 
                to show everyone's reflection on these artworks and analyzing their popularity.

                In this assignment, I participated in GovHack 2022 because I 
                believed it is a rare opportunity that I could meet people with 
                very different background and have an unforgetable experience.
            </p>
            
            <h3 class="fade-in">Idea Development</h3>
            <p class="fade-in">
                Firstly, we explored all the challenges to see if anything was interesting. Everyone in the team pasted the challenge’s links on a shared google document and wrote down some comments. While browsing the challenges and data, I tried to think of how to solve the problem, what datasets might be helpful, and what can this challenge connect with other challenges. 
                <br><br>
                After viewing some challenges and data, I found some challenges interesting, which also have some datasets that should be usable for us to analyze. For example, there was a challenge called “Digital Skills” hoping competitors could find a solution to help Queenslanders keep up with the increasing demand for digital skills. I felt this is an interesting topic because it is also happening in my country. Nowadays, many jobs require modern technical skills, and people want to learn to earn a better salary. However, many people do not know how to begin or what to do. Therefore, I provided an idea that we could build a job recommend platform so that when people visit the website, they can see what the most demanding jobs are and what the skill requirements of these jobs are. By doing that, they could understand the trend in the workplace, and it can help them decide what kind of skills they want to learn.
                <br><br>
                Moreover, I also found some datasets that might be helpful if we want to develop this idea. For instance, I found a dataset of the Queensland government, which is data on Queensland’s industry development plans. The data contains the program’s name, budget, start date, and so on, which could be very helpful for us to analyze what are some related programs that might benefit the job-seekers in Queensland.

                After checking the data in detail, we locked in our idea of a matching website for people who want to develop digital skills and businesses facing some challenges that need to be solved. Then, we started allocating the tasks, and I was assigned to build the website in a limited time. 
                At that moment, I had only learned some simple HTML and CSS syntax, so it was a big challenge.
                <br><br>
                However, I firstly design the website layout and structure while the design 
                team was working on our demonstration video. Then, I built the template of 
                the homepage, and I collected some pictures to make our website look more 
                engaging.
                <br><br>
                In this limited time, I tried to learn how to retrieve and present the 
                real-time data on our website, but I was not able to figure it out before the time ran out, unfortunately.

                was to connect businesses, communities, and individuals together.

                In this assignment, we had to build a project in a team. This project has to be a web-based application presenting data from the assigned datasets, and we should think of various creative ways so that the application is interactive and engaging.

            <h3 class="fade-in">Proposal Milestone</h3>
            <p class="fade-in">
                We started by looking at every member's A2 posters to get some inspiration. After discussion, We decided to extend a member's idea, using the dataset of Brisbane park and astronomy APIs to recommend parks to users who live in Brisbane city and want to find a place to relax and stargaze. We chose this concept because we all agreed this seemed to be an appealing and romantic idea that could be interesting.

                After we settled on our project theme, we started researching and looking for more helpful datasets and APIs. In this session, I was responsible for researching the data and APIs. I found the Astronomy API and weather forecast API could be helpful for our project. Then, I planned out the initial concept of how we could implement these APIs. This draft illustrated that we could use the park's latitude and longitude as the APIs' parameters.

                After the first proposal, we got plenty of feedback, and I was responsible to organize our responses document. When organizing the feedback, I suggested we have to think of some more interactive way to present our data. For example, we should narrow down our target audience so we can focus more on their needs.

                Because of this, we came up with an idea that our users should be photographers who like to take photos from the night sky. We used this concept as the foundation, we figured out a way that we can solve the problem of the recommendation of stargazing locations based on these users' experiences. To do that, we need to encourage them to share their experiences on this platform, so we think of a gaming feature, a mission board. By implementing a mission board, they can acquire a sense of achievement from completing the tasks. This also gave our project more interactive and engaging features.
                <br><br>
                After we all agreed on this concept, we started planning our MVP during the studio session. We listed all the features we had thought about and prioritized them by level of importance. Also, we made a paper prototype to collect feedback from the user tests. In this prototype, I worked on the upload photo part. To build a prototype, I got a chance to plan how the functionality and the flow should be on our website. I had to think as I am one of the users and if it is intuitive to me when I do the test myself.

                We collected great feedback from the insightful students taking the DECO1800/7180. At this point, I started to build our website template and database, and I tried to implement the APIs on the website. As the leader of the programming team, I broke our project plan into tiny tasks by the webpage and functionality and planned out our developing milestones. In this case, we could have a clear direction and manage the workload of each member easily.

                To finalize our project, we built a website that aims to provide a platform for photographers interested in nighttime astrophotography to share and explore various parks around the Brisbane area.

                On the home page, users can browse around popular photos and parks. Their popularity depends on the number of likes. After having an initial understanding of this website, they could also see what kind of missions they could attend. Then, they could upload their photos and experience to gain points. On the home page, they can also search for astronomy information by selecting which park they want to go to and when they want to go. The astronomy APIs will take the parameter they selected and return the pictures of the moon phase and star chart.

            <h2 class="fade-in">Reflection</h2>

            <h3 class="fade-in">A1</h3>
            <p class="fade-in">
                When I did the A1 assignment, I got plenty of chances to review what I have done throughout this course. I have found that I did not have a good habit of planning and designing. For example, I used to plan out everything in my mind, but it was such a setback when I wanted to look back at what I had done and why I made this decision. Because of this, it took me much more time to reflect on all my achievements. Therefore, I realized the importance of documenting every step of my brainstorming process. By doing this, I will be able to review my work easier and keep improving my planning skills naturally.
            </p>

            <h3 class="fade-in">A2</h3>
            <p class="fade-in">
                At the end of this course, I looked back at what I designed in A2, and I felt that although my idea was realistic and detailed, the way of presenting data could be more creative. At that moment, I did not know how a website could design to be more engaging by adding interactive features. For example, there is no constraint that geographic data must be present on a map. It might be reasonable and workable, but it is sort of boring. Also, maybe not just design a search engine for people to look up information. Instead, I can try to think of other ways to present data such as a puzzle game or a role-playing game. 
                <br><br>
                It was a bit of a shame that I only focused on how the data could work without trying to think outside the box. After I went through this course, I saw many fabulous ideas come from other insightful students, which broaden my view of designing an application. Although making sure that the concept is workable is critical, I can improve the design of interactivity and creativity. I believe I will keep that in mind and try to implement this reflection in my future design project.

            <p class="fade-in">
                When I look back at the experience of attending GovHack, I feel that I could have done many things better. At that moment, I was a total programming beginner who just started to learn HTML and CSS. Therefore, even a simple tiny feature on the website took me some time to figure out how to do it properly. If I could attend it again now, I would not need to spend the same amount of time on that, and I could have much more time to develop other complex features.

                Secondly, I felt that our strategy for developing solutions was too ambitious to focus on critical issues. We tried to think of a solution to include at least 5 challenges, so we got a bigger chance to win the rewards. However, it also led to the result that our solution was either not straightforward enough for each challenge or we were not able to solve the problem directly. Therefore, if I could attend again, I would try to focus on one or two challenges that I am interested in, so I could spend my time producing a more clarified concept and developing a more complete project. 
                <br><br>
                Overall, it was still a great experience that I had a chance to work with talented people and learn from them. I am pleased with our result and more importantly, I am proud that I built a prototype with limited knowledge and learned lots of things under time pressure.

                When I reflect on this project, the most significant thing I want to improve is that we did not plan well in our MVP, and this resulted in some problems. Firstly, as a tutor pointed out during the tradeshow, our MVP was still too general. We thought our MVP should include all aspects of our idea, so we could demonstrate it better. However, it turned out that we wanted too many functions, and we ran out of time to finish them all. As a result, our application was not a fully functioning website. Every page has demonstrated partial functionality, but the function does not connect. It also made us pay during the development process that we got too much to do, and it was hard to plan the schedule. In addition, another programmer and I are studying the first semester, so many techniques are too complex and took us more time to figure out. Because of this, it made it harder for us to follow the schedule since we usually spent more time on a function than we expected. Therefore, if we planned our MVP more simply, though we might not get to demonstrate the whole concept on our website, we could have a project showing complete functionality.
                <br><br>
                Also, after this experience, I realized the importance of time management, communication management, and cross-culture communication. A team needs to achieve these standards to become a high-performance team. This project needed to spend a lot of time on it, so time management skill was very crucial. For instance, when I planned the programming schedule, I would try to break each function into smaller tasks. By doing this, it should be easier for us to follow the weekly progress plan, and we could be well-prepared to respond to any unexpected incident. To complete a project in a team, we should also value the importance of communication. When doing this kind of project, I would want to plan the team schedule in the initial stage and have meetings more frequently so that we could arrange the workload of each member better and have a better quality of work. Additionally, we could make sure that everyone on the team has a clear and same direction. Besides this, respect plays a significant role in communication, so we must respect everyone irrespective of their culture and background.

                Nevertheless, I enjoyed the challenges of this assignment, and I am rather proud that I challenged myself to take responsibility for complex and difficult jobs, which no one wanted to do. Although the result might not be perfect, I have learned lots of programming skills after the development process. Moreover, through this lesson learning, I have acquired not only technical skills but also experience in teamwork, brainstorming, communication, project management, and leadership. Because of this, I get to improve my soft skills, which can help me be well-prepared when I work in the workplace in the future.

            <h3 class="fade-in">Course Reflection</h3>
            <p class="fade-in">
                Looking back at my first-week journal, I wrote down the expectation of this course that I could learn the required skills to develop a website and a little project management skill. Without a doubt, the result was definitely beyond my anticipation. I have learned Basic HTML, CSS, Javascript, and designing considerations from the content of the lectures. Additionally, with the assistance of the supportive tutor in the workshop, I acquired knowledge of Javascript, PHP, MySQL, and so on. When I encountered problems during the A4 development, the studio's tutors were very willing to help us and gave us insightful advice. With this plenty of support, I get to well-experience the procedure of developing a project from scratch.
                <br><br>
                However, the workload of this course was a bit too much, especially for first-semester students. I felt I needed to spend more time on this course's assignment to get a high grade, even though I had already spent lots of time on it. Not to mention I did not have any fundamental knowledge of web development.
                <br><br>
                Nonetheless, I have learned a lot by driving myself to do my best on every assignment. I want to express my appreciation for the effort the teaching team has made, and I am very grateful for every support and feedback I have received from staff and peers. I will carry the learned lessons, and apply the knowledge in my future career.
